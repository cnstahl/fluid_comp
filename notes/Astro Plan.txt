Learn Athena 


rerun lecoanet, maybe with new switches
div B being zero is a difficulty 

dispersion relation for instability 

One meeting with Stone Wednesday 


————————————————————To Do————————————————————————————

Keep updated with master and shearingbox 

Play around with mpi

—————————————————Thermal Fluxes——————————————————————

Does AthenaArray assignment copy? Or just reference?
  (eg diffusion.cpp line 106)

  Just reference

Which variables should be set in athinput, and which in pgen?



Is c (dye) constrained to [0,1]?



Assume ndim < 4?

  It is. Larger AthenaArrays handle other variables.
