Fluid dynamics 
MHD problems 

rerun lecoanet, maybe with new switches 

One meeting with Stone Wednesday 


————————————————————To Do————————————————————————————

Keep updated with master and shearingbox 

Thermal fluxes

——Friday——

Sound wave with no diffusion — test numerical diff
Sound wave with just viscosity — make sure it works
Sound wave with both diffusions — just check again


—————————————————Thermal Fluxes——————————————————————

Is c (dye) constrained to [0,1]?

  

Calculating fluxes
  NON_BAROTROPIC_EOS?
  Why is there a minus sign?
    (viscosity.cpp line 58)
  How to update dt? - section 4.6

Notes
  Don’t do geometry at first



Problems with visit



Some things are named improperly but I can fix that later
  `hydro_flux_defined` really means viscosity is defined
  Fix by using `if (nuiso_ != 0) etc.



Currently: viscosity sets all difluxes
           thermal updates IEN diflux, resetting before if needed
           with thermal fluxes allocate arrays larger than needed
           Should chiiso be a function?
