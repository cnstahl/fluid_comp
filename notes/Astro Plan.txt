Fluid dynamics 
MHD problems 

rerun lecoanet, maybe with new switches 

One meeting with Stone Wednesday 


————————————————————To Do————————————————————————————

Keep updated with master and shearingbox 

Thermal fluxes

Play around with mpi?

—————————————————Thermal Fluxes——————————————————————

Which variables should be set in athinput, and which in pgen?

  

Is c (dye) constrained to [0,1]?

  

Calculating fluxes
  Why are loops longer with MAGNETIC_FIELDS_ENABLED?
    (viscosity.cpp line 40)
  Why is FaceXdx() diferent than FaceYdy()? - Appendix
    What is h2v()? 
  NON_BAROTROPIC_EOS?
  Why is there a minus sign?
    (viscosity.cpp line 58)
  No geometry derivative term?
  How to update dt? - section 4.6

Notes
  ALLOCATE NEW ARRAY
  Don’t do geometry at first
